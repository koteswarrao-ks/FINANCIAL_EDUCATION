    "content": "Budgeting means creating a simple plan for how to use money. A budget helps separate needs (things you must have, such as food, school supplies) and wants (things that are fun but optional, such as games or toys). Children learn that when they receive pocket money they can divide it into: Save (money for future goals), Spend (money for small treats), and Share (money used to help others or gifts). Budgeting teaches delayed gratification, discipline, and how to make choices when money is limited."

    "content": "A basic child-friendly budgeting method is the 3-jar system: Save Jar (for long-term goals), Spend Jar (for everyday wants), and Share Jar (for helping or gifting). Budgeting also involves tracking how much is received weekly or monthly, setting a small goal, and planning how many weeks it will take to save enough for that goal. Budgeting helps children avoid impulse spending and understand the value of planning."

    "content": "Value creation is the process of making something useful, helpful, or enjoyable for others. Value is created when effort, creativity, or skills improve someone’s situation. Children create value by making craft items, solving a problem for a family member, teaching another child, or completing helpful tasks. Value creation does not always mean money—it means providing something others appreciate. Money is often a reward for value provided."

    "content": "Value comes from usefulness. When a child uses effort, creativity, knowledge, or time to make life easier or better for someone, they create value. Examples include: organizing a messy shelf, making a birthday card, drawing a poster for a school event, or helping a younger child understand homework. Understanding value creation helps children see that earning is connected to helping others, not just asking for money."

Saving money in a bank account that earns interest is a simple form of investing.
